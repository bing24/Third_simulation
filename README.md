Resource management
Using multiple charging robots periodically get a team of working robots recharged.

Workflow

1. 
Add operating robots and charging robots using Simulation.m 
ID will be automatically assigned

2. 
Set trajectories, laps and charging window of operating robots using OperatingRobot.m
Set initial positions and speed of charging robots using ChargingRobot.m 
Set time step, meeting point time and charging time using Simulation.m

3. 
Calculated the tracjectories of charging robots using Simulation.m

4.
Make the video 

Q:
1. How to define operating robots speed?
2. How to automatically update parameters?
3. How to do the indent stuff?
